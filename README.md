## Aim of the pogram


After trying to minimize the energy of an atom cluster in 2D plan, I decided to try a spherical starting configuration. 
However, as of now, no method allows us place N equidistant points on the surface of the sphere.

This program based, on the paper "How to generate equidistributed points on the surface of a sphere" written by Markus 
Deserno (see proper reference below in **References**), tries to solve this problem.
As mentioned in the paper, the results are approximate; still, after a few tries with different N values, the program
seems to provide accurate results, which can be really helpful if small error margins are tolerated (see **Results** 
section).
